# 👋 Hey there, I’m @itsnotworkingimgoingafk
> "If it's broken, just give me a minute...or a few hours...or a week. I'll be back (eventually)." 😅

### 👀 Things I’m Interested In...
- Debugging the mysteries of why code suddenly decides to "not work."
- Finding creative ways to go AFK while *looking* like I'm fixing things.  
- Exploring new programming languages, frameworks, and sometimes, naps.

### 🌱 Currently Learning...
- How to fix code without breaking something else.
- Efficient AFK techniques that don’t make my team suspicious. 🤫
- The fine art of *just one more* commit before calling it a day.

### 💞️ Looking to Collaborate On...
- Projects that are as chaotic as they are challenging.
- Debugging marathons with fellow "AFK" enthusiasts.
- Any project where going AFK might, somehow, miraculously, solve the bug.

### 📫 Reach Me At...
- Leave a comment, open an issue, or...honestly, I might be AFK. But I’ll get back to you. Probably.

### 😄 Pronouns: 
- They/Them (but also open to He/Him and She/Her)

### ⚡ Fun Fact:
- I once went AFK and came back to find that my code had fixed itself. True story. Sometimes, all you need is a bit of distance...and coffee.
